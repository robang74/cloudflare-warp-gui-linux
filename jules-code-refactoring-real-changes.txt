RATIONALE

I worked as a professional software developer for many years but Python is not one
of those languages that I can claim to master. I use Python in an opportunistic way.

Under this PoV, I was curious to understand how much Jules could help to improvethis
little project of mine. Which is also an opportunistic project, something that I would
not do it as a hobby but not for a client or a market use. I was in need of that,
alternatives were not meeting my needs, I developed a best-effort solution for myself.

The best use-case test for Google Jules, working on a code that "just works for me" but
Jules can bring to the next level, something that can go to the market as a product.

APPROACH

> Check the code for potential issues and improvements. Not a code redesign
> just small changes that can provide relevant advantages or fixing bugs.

Then, I let it go its own way with "ok, proceed", despite proposing a more
impactful code refactoring compared with my very modest and practical request.

*** Google Jule Code Refactoring Claims: ***************************************

This commit introduces a number of improvements to the Cloudflare WARP GUI application.
The main changes are:

- Refactoring: The main application file, `warp-gui/warp-gui.py`, has been refactored 
  to separate the UI code from the application logic. The non-UI code has been moved 
  to a new file, `warp-gui/actions.py`.
- Security: The use of `eval()` has been removed from the code to reduce security risks.
  The `getoutput` function has been replaced with `subprocess.run` for better security
  and error handling.
- Installation: The `install.sh` script has been improved to provide more robust
  dependency checking and to use a `requirements.txt` file for Python modules.
- Bug Fixes: A syntax error in the `UpdateThread` class that could have caused
  the application to crash has been fixed.
